Dispays a .obj file into the console window.
Felt bored, made this :)

Donno if I'm going to keep working on this.
If I do, Here's a list of things I want to implement.
1. Viewport clipping
2. Texture support
3. glTF loading
4. Better orbit controls (Raycast into scene to pivot around that point)

Tested some .obj files from: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html
