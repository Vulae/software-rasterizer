Displays a .obj file into the console window.
Felt bored, made this :)

Donno if I'm going to keep working on this.
If I do, Here's a list of things I want to implement.
1. Viewport clipping
2. Texture support
3. glTF loading (Somewhat supported)
4. Better orbit controls (Raycast into scene to pivot around that point)

Tested some .obj files from: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html
Tested some .glb files re-exported from Blender: https://www.reddit.com/r/Spyro/comments/122ubg2/i_compiled_all_of_spyro_1s_levels_into_a/
